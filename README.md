# ♾️ Infinity Tic Tac Toe

**Infinity Tic Tac Toe** is a unique, strategic Flutter-based reimagination of the traditional Tic Tac Toe game. Unlike the original version, each player can only have **three symbols on the board at any time**, and gameplay is enhanced by a **symbol swap ability** and **blocked cells** that introduce new tactical depth.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Classic 3x3 grid with a twist.
- ♻️ Only 3 symbols allowed per player — oldest moves disappear.

- 🚫 Randomly blocks a cell for a few turns after swapping.
- 🕒 Cooldown system adds a layer of strategy.
- 🎨 Built using Flutter for clean UI and smooth performance.
